Polish localization by [Piotr Karol Marek Żółtowski](https://github.com/Piter432)

## Localization

If you'd like to see this extension in another language:

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a copy of `_locales/en_US`.
3. Rename the folder to match the language code of your new language.
4. Translate `messages.json`.
5. Translate `description.txt` (this goes on Opera's add-ons site)
5. Commit it and send me a pull request.

See [chrome.i18n](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/i18n) for more details on the localization system.
