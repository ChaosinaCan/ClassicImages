Classic Images brings back some of the image handling features that were lost in the transition from Opera 12 to 15.

Current features:
- Alt+Ctrl+Click to save images (Shortcut keys are configurable. Opera 20+ required to use "Save as" dialog.)
- Image properties pop-up

Let me know if there are any other image features you'd like brought back.
